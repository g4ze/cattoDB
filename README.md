# cattoDB
just a new database existing out there purring in the wild.

so, ive ben thinking of first of all having basic functionalities.
to begin with i beleive i should start with the commands that dont handle file making or deletion but just file manipulation part; ofcourse since it is a catto we would have things sound similar to it.
***
###commands
Command | Functionality
--------|--------------
-catto-scratch-all OR catto-del-all | deletes everything in the current scope
-catto-scratch-{id} OR catto-del-{id} | deletes the element of that id in the current scope
