# cattoDB
just a new NOSQL DBMS existing out there purring in the wild.

so, ive ben thinking of first of all having basic functionalities.
to begin with i beleive i should start with the commands that dont handle file making or deletion but just file manipulation part; ofcourse since it is a catto we would have things sound similar to it.
